*** Think BACKWARDS!!! => From what decision we want to make to the actual decision making
process.

*** Three different types of analytics:

1) Descriptive Analytics: Descriptive Analytics as its name suggests, helps us describe
what things look like now or what happened in the past. The idea of course is to use that
information to better understand the business environment and how it works. And to apply
that knowledge along with business acumen to make better decisions going forward.
Descriptive Analytics can take the form of simple aggregations or cross tabulations data.
Simple statistical measures like means, medians, and standard deviations. More
sophisticated statistics like distributions, confidence intervals and test of hypotheses
or advanced association or clustering algorithms.

2) Predictive Analytics: Predictive Analytics help us take what we know about what
happened in the past, and use that information to help us predict what will happen in the
future. This almost always involves the application of advanced statistical methods or
other numeric techniques such as linear or logistic regression. Tree based algorithms,
neural networks and simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation.

3) Prescriptive Analytics: This type of analysis helps explicitly link analysis to
decision making by providing recommendations on what we should do or what choice we
should make to achieve a certain outcome. It usually involves the integration of
numerical optimization techniques with business rules and even financial model.

*** Information - Action Value Chain

*** Store - Extract - Analyze Data

*** Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS)

*** BI - Business Intelligence

*** Data Virtualization - Through data virtualization we make it look like data is in
                          one place.

*** Data Federation - With data we actually fit that data into a common integrated data
                      model.

*** In reational database system, rows = records and columns = fields / attributes

*** Normalization - The notion of trying to break data into different ideas is called
    normalization. It turns out that normalizing data eliminates redundancy by ensuring
    that we store unique data only once versus multiple times.
